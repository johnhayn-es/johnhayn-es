# Hairy Bikers' Diet Club
![HBDC Website]()

After 2 years of working very closely with Si and Dave as their online content producer, I was asked to assume the role of project manager for the Hairy Bikers' Diet Club - an online weight-loss community based on the very popular Hairy Dieters series. 

We focused on real food, for real people - sharing real results! The Diet Club quickly became one of the largest communities of its type in the UK, spawning three best-selling cookbooks. To help spread this message, I recruited eight Bikers super-fans to help manage the dedicated Facebook page to share their own stories (in exchange for signed goodies and a few meet-and-greet opportunities).

### Highlights
* Most impactful ThunderClap campaign of 2013/14, with more than 1,000,000 
* Created the logo and influenced the branding
* Arranged a Quid Pro Quo deal with Trinity Mirror Group to publish a weekly weight-loss column, which I ghost-wrote
* Organised a special diet-themed shoot for Waitrose TV

Low fat kebabs and pies? Who wouldn't love that.

## My Role 
Nov 2013 - Apr 2014

### Project Manager
I managed internal and external stakeholders through the launch of the Diet Club, built the online community and lined up content product and PR opportunities.
