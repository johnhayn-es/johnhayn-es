## Career

I am highly motivated and thrive in a fast-paced environment with an air of uncertainty. I am an adept and versatile supporting player, the sort of person that start-up founders seek as a key early employee. I have recently focused on design strategy and leadership, defining how the design function supports the business as a whole.

My career to date combines three interconnected disciplines; design, strategy and storytelling. This combination enables me to do the work I do today:

* Principles; establishing the fundamental purpose of the design function within the organisation
* Strategy; simple, value-based strategies to help the organisation reach its goals
* Research; surfacing insights quickly so that the team can make faster decisions
* Product & service design; building effective and efficient solutions
* Measuring value; analysing the impact of the changes we make

You can see all the jobs I've had on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmahaynes/).

### My principles

I am guided by three personal principles:

* **Intention**; the work I produce is justifiable and has meaning
* **Collaboration**; my role is to work with others to find the solution
* **Accuracy**; the work I produce is accurate

## About me

I enjoy getting out for a run. During a phase where I was commuting to London, I held an advisory position for Govia Thameslink (southern Railway, Thameslink, Gatwick Express, Great Northern) between 2015 and 2019. I play guitar for <a href="https://thegreatfire.co.uk">The Great Fire</a>. I (build and) maintain websites for my friends: <a href="http://printersplayhouse.co.uk">Printer's Playhouse</a> and <a href="http://moarguitars.com">Moar Guitars</a>. I'm currently learning as much as I can about web3 technology.

*I offer remote coaching and mentorship sessions over lunch, email me to find out more and book a slot (mail [at] johnhayn.es).*
