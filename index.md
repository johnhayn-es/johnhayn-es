Hello. Here's a little information about me. 

If you read my résumé you will notice that my career combines three interconnected disciplines; design, growth and storytelling. This combination enables me to do the work I do today as a product designer:

* Strategy, vision and mission; crafting design strategies to help the company reach its goals and communicate them across the team
* User research and validation; I'm a proponent for placing <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-centered-design">User Centered Design ↗</a> at the heart of the Agile process, conducting field studies and surfacing insights quickly so that the team can make faster decisions
* Design assets; I use the principles of <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Atomic Design ↗</a> to establish a library of reusable components that enable me to quickly create high-fidelity prototypes to communicate my ideas
* Measuring value; I am data-driven and well-versed in writing SQL (PostgresQL and MySQL) to query databases and building custom reports to visualise and interpret the data

In the last 7+ years I have worked on a variety of digital products and services including:

* Native iOS and Android apps
* B2C subscription services
* SaaS web platforms 
* White-label enterprise software
* Designing and publishing design systems

I'm a Senior Product Designer building a platform for a smarter, fairer entertainment industry at <a href="http://www.wegotpop.com">We Got POP ↗</a>.

In my spare time:

* I play guitar as one half of the acoustic duo <a href="https://staceyandjohn.co.uk">Stacey & John</a> and guitar for <a href="https://thegreatfire.co.uk">The Great Fire</a>
* I (build and) maintain websites for my friends: <a href="http://printersplayhouse.co.uk">Printer's Playhouse</a> and <a href="http://moarguitars.com">Moar Guitars</a>
* I build boutique guitar pedals via <a href="http://hayneseffects.com">Haynes Effects</a>
* I enjoy getting out for a run
* I’m interested in the future of transport and held an advisory position for GoVia Thameslink between 2015 and 2019.
