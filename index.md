This year my team and I have been focused on two major projects; [rebuilding our Timesheets product][1] and validating designs for a [novel Digital Payroll service][6]. 

Over the past 12 months: 
* I implemented a [new product discovery process][2] to enable anyone on my team to document, map and prioritise user needs across any of [our user personas][14]
* I lead the team to conduct >50 [on-site and remote user research sessions][3] and we mapped nearly 900 user stories over 45 jobs-to-be-done
* We defined a roadmap and I designed design multiple impactful [timesheets][5] and [payroll][6] features.
* I was flown to India and used the personas and job maps to [train our offshore QA team about our customers][7].

Over the same period I have spearheaded the UK team's data strategy. This involved: 
* [Defining the UK's strategic KPIs][8]
* Putting my data analysis skills to good use to [operationalise the MVP dashboards][9]
* Increasing the data-literacy of the team by [publishing regular briefings][10]
* and, are certifying as a Qlik data analyst, training myself on how to build efficient data models as I migrate our reporting into Qlik

### Other interesting stuff I've done in the last few years
* I raised [Â£560k of non-dilutive funding to build a machine learning (ML) model][11]that can predict the safety of utilities worksites across the UK
* Debuted as a speaker at few events, including [CRAP talks][12]
* I ran [further and faster than the previous year][13] and ran 5k in less than 21 minutes
