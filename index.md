# Hey. I'm John.

I have delivered hundreds of millions in revenue growth by designing valuable, highly satisfying enterprise-level SaaS products that measurably save people time and money.

* **IxDF certified user experience manager** (with distinction)
* **Qlik certified data analyst** and passionate about building a culture of data-reliance
* **Hands-on experience with AI**, building and designing-for predictive machine learning systems
* **Led the design** and **product/design teams** for start-ups and enterprise B2B Fintech businesses

I am highly strategic and outcome-driven; I use KPIs to shape how I plan, execute and measure-the-success-of each initiative that I work on.  I have a vast toolkit of skills and frameworks that enable me to work at pace while maintaining high credibility in the design process. The majority of my recent experience has been leading and collaborating with teams on enterprise B2B financial technology - contracting, timesheets and payroll services used by the like of Netflix, Apple and the BBC.
