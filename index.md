I work at [Entertainment Partners][1] where I lead the UK design team to build financial services for the film and television industry.

I believe the purpose of the product design function is to live in the future, then come back to help the business plot a course toward it. My work combines [outcome-driven innovation]() with [continuous, legacy-free reinvention]() to ensure that what we build delivers optimal value to our customers, protecting and securing our position as market leaders.

<!-- I've held a number of key product and design roles over the last 10 years. I'm interested in the future of work & travel and previously held an advisory positions at Govia Thameslink and London Water-Enabled Transport. You can see all other the jobs Iâ€™ve had on my [LinkedIn profile][2]. -->
