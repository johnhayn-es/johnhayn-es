## Hello. I am John, the Lead Product Designer for [Entertainment Partners][1] where I lead the UK design team, building financial services for the entertainment industry.

As a designer, I occupy an unusual position; I am leading both UX and product intelligence strategy for EPUK, combining product design with hands-on data analysis. 

When working, I combine two distinct principles, continuous legacy-free reinvention (the freedom to solve problems with lateral thinking) and outcome-driven innovation (focusing on how to impact user outcomes). My focus on ROI and user outcomes enables me to practice very purposeful design, resulting in lean product and service solutions that have a measurable impact on our customers and bottom line.

<!-- I've held a number of key product and design roles over the last 10 years. I'm interested in the future of work & travel and previously held an advisory positions at Govia Thameslink and London Water-Enabled Transport. You can see all other the jobs Iâ€™ve had on my [LinkedIn profile][2]. -->
