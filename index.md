## Career

My first job involved teaching celebrities like Ant & Dec how to tweet. Over the last 8+ years I have held a number of product and growth roles, but most recently I have dedicated my time to design and design leadership.

My career to-date combines three interconnected disciplines; product design, strategy and storytelling. This combination enables me to do the work I do today:

* Design principles; establishing the fundamental purpose of the design function within the organisation
* Design and business strategy; implementing strategies to help the organisation reach its goals
* Research; practicing UCD and surfacing insights quickly so that the team can make faster decisions
* Product and service design; building effective and efficient solutions
* Measuring value; analysing the impact of the changes we make

### Design principles

I am guided by three personal design principles:

* **Intention**; the work I produce is justifiable and has meaning
* **Accuracy**; the work I produce is accurate
* **Collaboration**; my role is to work with others to find the solution

## About me

I enjoy getting out for a run. I held an advisory position for GoVia Thameslink between 2015 and 2019. I play guitar for <a href="https://thegreatfire.co.uk">The Great Fire</a>. I (build and) maintain websites for my friends: <a href="http://printersplayhouse.co.uk">Printer's Playhouse</a> and <a href="http://moarguitars.com">Moar Guitars</a>. I'm currently learning as much as I can about web3 technology.

*I offer remote coaching and mentorship sessions over lunch, email me to find out more and book a slot (mail [at] johnhayn.es).*
