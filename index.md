## Hey. I'm John, Lead Product Designer at [EP][0].

I am a hands-on UX leader with acute generalist skills: 
* **IxDF certified user experience manager** (with distinction)
* **Qlik certified data analyst** and passionate about building a culture of data-reliance
* **Hands-on experience with AI**, building and designing-for predictive machine learning systems
* **Led the design** and **product/design teams** for start-ups and larger corporate businesses

in short, I have thousands of hours of experience defining problems, designing solutions and measuring their impact. 

## Recently...
I have been working on three major projects:
1. Rebuilding our [timesheets product][1]
2. Desiging a novel addition to our [payroll service][2] 
3. Spearheading the [UK's data strategy][6]. 

### In the past 12 months
* I implemented a new [product discovery process][3], mapping the problem space by documenting 880 user stories across 51 job maps
* I lead the team to conduct 146 [user research sessions][4]
* I designed design multiple impactful [timesheets][1] and [payroll][2] features.
* I flew to India to [train our offshore QA team][5] about our users.
* [I aggregated our busines-wide KPIs][6] and embedded them into our processes and culture

### In the last few years
