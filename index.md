## Hello. I am John, the Lead Product Designer for [Entertainment Partners][1] where I lead the UK design team, building financial services for the entertainment industry.

I practice purposeful design that results in measurable outcomes for our customers and our business.

In my opinion, I've had an interesting career. I started working in content production before making the leap into tech. I have (twice) started by applying content-lead strategies to improve user growth, before switching roles to take responsibility for the broader user experience. 

After one too many sprints, I switched from a product-focus to design (though my colleagues have described me as the most product-manager designer that you've ever worked with). My work combines outcome-driven innovation with continuous, legacy-free reinvention to ensure that what we build delivers optimal value to our customers, protecting and securing our position as market leaders.  

I believe the purpose of the product design function is to venture into the future, then come back to help the business plot a course toward it.
