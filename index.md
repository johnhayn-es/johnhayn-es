# Recently...
At the start of 2023 my team and I were faced with the task of [launching and iterating a Timesheets product][1]. As part of this project: 

* I implemented a [new product discovery process][2] to document our users jobs-to-be-done in a relational research system.  
* I lead the team to conduct 30+ [on-site and remote user research sessions][3] to build a clear picture of the problem-space (creating and prioritising 880 user stories across 45 job maps)
* I used this framework to analyse which roadmap items would be most impactful and assess how and where we were ahead of our competitors. 
* I designed design multiple impactful [Timesheets features][5], then, when the business pivoted, I created initial designs for a [novel Digital Payroll service][6].

As a by-product of the success of the process and relational system we built, [I was flown to India to train our offshore QA team about our customers][7].

Over the same period I have spearheaded the UK team's data strategy. This involved: 
* [Defining the UK's strategic KPIs][8]
* Putting my data analysis skills to good use to [operationalise the MVP dashboards][9]
* Increasing the data-literacy of the team by [publishing regular briefings][10]
* and, are certifying as a Qlik data analyst, training myself on how to build efficient data models as I migrate our reporting into Qlik

## Other interesting stuff I've done in the last few years
* I raised [Â£560k of non-dilutive funding to build a machine learning (ML) model][11]that can predict the safety of utilities worksites across the UK
* Debuted as a speaker at few events, including [CRAP talks][12]
* I ran [further and faster than the previous year][13] and ran 5k in less than 21 minutes
