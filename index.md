## Hey. I'm John, Lead Product Designer at [EP][0].

I have thousands of hours experience defining problems, designing solutions and measuring their impact. 
* **IxDF certified user experience designer** (with distinction)
* **Qlik certified data analyst** and passionate about building a culture of data-reliance
* **Led the design** and **teams of designers and product folk** for start-ups and larger corporate businesses

I believe great design happens at the juncture between compelling stories and unequivocable data. I am outcome-led; my practice involves working to understand the underlying motivations of users, identifying the most impactful KPIs and then leading teams to build products that measurably impact them. 

## Recently...
I have been working on three major projects:
1. Minimising the time it takes to [submit a timesheet to <5 minutes][1]
2. Desiging a novel addition to our [payroll service][2] 
3. Spearheading the [UK's data strategy][6]. 

### In the past 12 months
* I implemented a new [product discovery process][3], mapping the problem space by documenting 880 user stories across 51 job maps
* I lead the team to conduct 146 [user research sessions][4]
* I designed design multiple impactful [timesheets][1] and [payroll][2] features.
* I flew to India to [train our offshore QA team][5] about our users.
* [I aggregated our busines-wide KPIs][6] and embedded them into our processes and culture

### In the last few years
* I raised [Â£560k of non-dilutive funding to build a ML model][7] that can predict the safety of utilities worksites across the UK
* [I debuted as a speaker][8] at few events
* I ran [further and faster than the previous year][9] and ran 5k in less than 21 minutes
