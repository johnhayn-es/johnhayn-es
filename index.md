Hello. Here's a little about me. 

I'm a Senior Product Designer and lead the design team building a platform for a smarter, fairer entertainment industry at <a href="http://www.wegotpop.com">We Got POP â†—</a>. I built this site to host <a href="../portfolio">my portfolio</a> and <a href="../blog">blog</a>.

### Career

Over the last 8+ years I have held product and growth roles on a variety of projects including native apps, SaaS web platforms, B2C subscription services and enterprise software.

My career combines three interconnected disciplines; product design, growth and storytelling. This combination enables me to do the work I do today:

* Design principles; establishing the fundamental purpose of the design function within the organisation
* Strategy; implementing strategies to help the organisation reach its goals
* Research; placing UCD at the heart of the Agile process, surfacing insights quickly so that the team can make faster decisions
* Design; creating boards and hi-fi prototypes to communicate my ideas 
* Measuring value; querying databases to build custom reports to visualise and interpret data

### Design principles

I am guided by three personal design principles:

* Intention; the work I produce is justifiable and has meaning
* Accuracy; the work I produce is accurate
* Collaboration; my role is to work with others to find the solution

### In my own time

* I enjoy getting out for a run
* I held an advisory position for GoVia Thameslink between 2015 and 2019
* I play guitar for <a href="https://thegreatfire.co.uk">The Great Fire</a>
* I (build and) maintain websites for my friends: <a href="http://printersplayhouse.co.uk">Printer's Playhouse</a> and <a href="http://moarguitars.com">Moar Guitars</a>
* I'm currently learning as much as I can about web3 technology

I offer remote coaching and mentorship sessions over lunch, email me to find out more and book a slot (mail [at] johnhayn.es).
