#### In the past 12 months: 
I have been focused on three major projects:
1. Rebuilding our [Timesheets product][1]
2. Validating a novel and industry-specific [Digital Payroll service][2] 
3. [Spearheading the UK's data strategy][6]. 

##### Over this period
* I implemented a [new product discovery process][3] to enable my team to map and prioritise user needs across [our user personas][4]
* I lead the team to conduct more than 50 [on-site and remote user research sessions][5] and mapped nearly 900 user stories over 45 jobs-to-be-done
* We defined a roadmap and I designed design multiple impactful [timesheets][1] and [payroll][2] features.
* I was flown to India and used the psonas and job maps to [train our offshore QA team about our customers][5].
* [Built a dashboard that aggregates our business-wide KPIs][6 and embedded its use into our processes and culture

#### Other interesting stuff I've done in the last few years
