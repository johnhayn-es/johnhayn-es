This year my team and I have been focused on two major projects; [rebuilding our Timesheets product][1] and validating a novel and industry-specific [Digital Payroll service][2]. 

#### In the past 12 months: 
* I implemented a [new product discovery process][3] to enable anyone on my team to document, map and prioritise user needs across any of [our user personas][4]
* I lead the team to conduct >50 [on-site and remote user research sessions][5] and we mapped nearly 900 user stories over 45 jobs-to-be-done
* We defined a roadmap and I designed design multiple impactful [timesheets][1] and [payroll][2] features.
* I was flown to India and used the personas and job maps to [train our offshore QA team about our customers][6].
* I have spearheaded the UK team's data strategy to [define and operationalise our business-wide KPIs][7]

### Other interesting stuff I've done in the last few years
* I raised [Â£560k of non-dilutive funding to build a machine learning (ML) model][8]that can predict the safety of utilities worksites across the UK
* Debuted as a speaker at few events, including [CRAP talks][9]
