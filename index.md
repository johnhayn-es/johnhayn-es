I work at Entertainment Partners where I lead the UK design team and am the principal designer on our international product suite.

I work with teams around the world to design products & services through thoughtful research, value-based strategy and hands-on collaboration.

I've held a number of key product and design roles over the last 10 years. I'm interested in the future of work & travel and previously held an advisory positions at Govia Thameslink (2015 and 2019) and London Water-Enabled Transport (2016-2017).
