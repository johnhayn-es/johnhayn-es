## Hello. I am John, the Lead Product Designer for [Entertainment Partners][1].

My career is threaded by three key disciplines; telling stories, making impactful things and measuring their success. I lead teams to define, quantify and prioritise customer needs. Where possible I practise radical candour - rapidly sharing user stories  and insights  to spark ideas from everyone in the business. My focus on understanding the intersection between business and customer value is why I have a track record for developing lean but highly impactful products & services. I am also an experienced and adaptable individual contributor with more than seven years leading and contributing to complex projects.
