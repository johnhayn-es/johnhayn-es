## Career

My first full-time job involved teaching celebrities like Ant & Dec how to tweet. In the same role, I ended up producing hours of online and social content - going behind the scenes on a lot of the shows I'd dreamt about working on. 

Over the last 8+ years I have held a number of key product and growth roles in small, fast-moving businesses. For years I positioned myself as an adept and versatile supporting player - the sort of person that start-up founders seek as a key early employee. More recently I have dedicated my time to specifically focus on design and design leadership.

My career to date combines three interconnected disciplines; design, strategy and storytelling. This combination enables me to do the work I do today:

* Design principles; establishing the fundamental purpose of the design function within the organisation
* Design and business strategy; implementing strategies to help the organisation reach its goals
* Research; practicing UCD and surfacing insights quickly so that the team can make faster decisions
* Product and service design; building effective and efficient solutions
* Measuring value; analysing the impact of the changes we make

You can see all the jobs I've had on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmahaynes/).

### My principles

I am guided by three personal principles:

* **Intention**; the work I produce is justifiable and has meaning
* **Collaboration**; my role is to work with others to find the solution
* **Accuracy**; the work I produce is accurate

## About me

I enjoy getting out for a run. During a phase where I was commuting to London, I held an advisory position for Govia Thameslink (southern Railway, Thameslink, Gatwick Express, Great Northern) between 2015 and 2019. I play guitar for <a href="https://thegreatfire.co.uk">The Great Fire</a>. I (build and) maintain websites for my friends: <a href="http://printersplayhouse.co.uk">Printer's Playhouse</a> and <a href="http://moarguitars.com">Moar Guitars</a>. I'm currently learning as much as I can about web3 technology.

*I offer remote coaching and mentorship sessions over lunch, email me to find out more and book a slot (mail [at] johnhayn.es).*
