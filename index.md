## Hey. I'm John, Lead Product Designer at [Entertainment Partners][0].

I have thousands of hours experience defining problems, desiging solutions and measuring their impact. 
* **IxDF certified** user experience designer (with distinction)
* **Qlik certified data analyst** and passionate about building a culture of data-reliance
* **Led the design** and **teams of designers and product folk** for start-ups and larger corporate businesses

### Recently...
At the start of 2023 my team and I were faced with the task of [launching and iterating a Timesheets product][1].

I implemented a [new product discovery process][2] to document our users jobs-to-be-done in a relational research system. We conducted numerous [on-site research sessions][3] and built a very clear picture of the problem-space and used this same framework to analyse which roadmap items would be most impactful. This enabled us to design multiple impactful [Timesheets features][1], as well as turn around an initial designs for a [novel Digital Payroll service][5] in less than 3 weeks. 

As a by-product of this, [I was flown to India to train our offshore QA team about our customers][5].

Over the same period I have spearheaded the UK team's data strategy. This involved [defining the UK's strategic KPIs][6] and then putting my data analysis skills to good use to [operationalise the MVP dashboards][7]. I also sought to increase the data-literacy of the team by [publishing regular briefings][8]. The final step of the strategy is to migrate our reporting into Qlik, which has meant [training myself on how to build efficient data models][9].  

### Other interesting stuff I've done in the last few years
* I raised [Â£560k of non-dilutive funding to build a machine learning (ML) model][10]that can predict the safety of utilities worksites across the UK
* Debuted as a speaker at few events, including [CRAP talks][11]
* I ran [further and faster than the previous year][12] and ran 5k in less than 21 minutes
