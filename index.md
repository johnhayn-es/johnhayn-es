# Hey. I'm John, the Lead Product Designer at [Entertainment Partners](0).

I have thousands of hours experience defining problems, desiging solutions for them and then measuring the impact they have. For brevity, I've chosen to keep this portfolio focused on more-recent examples of my work.

### Recently...
At the start of 2023 my team and I were faced with the task of [improving a newly-launched Timesheets product](1). The brief was open-ended; reduce the impact of customer pain-points, stabilise the service and introduce features that enable us to gain a higher market share (supporting more workflows).

I [implemented a new product discovery process](2) to help my team document our users jobs-to-be-done in a relational research system. Over the next six months we conducted numerous [on-site research sessions](3) and built a very clear picture of the problem-space and the holes in our current solution(s). We then used this same framework to [analyse which roadmap items would be most impactful](4) for the rest of the year. This enabled us to design multiple needle-moving new features for our [Timesheets product](1), as well as turn around initial designs for an end-to-end [novel Digital Payroll service](5) in less than 3 weeks. 

As an excellent by-product of this, I was also given the opportunity to [fly to India to train our offshore QA team about our customers](6) using the same list of user personas.

Over the same period (and off the side of my desk) I have spearheaded the UK team's data strategy. This involved hiring some excellent consultants to help [define the UK's strategic KPIs](7) and then putting my data analysis skills to good use to [operationalise the MVP dashboards](8). In order to maximise the number of people paying attention I have also sought to increase the data-literacy of the team by [publishing regular briefings](9) which have themselves garnered a lot of positive engagement. The final step of the strategy is to [migrate our reporting from DOMO into Qlik](10), which has meant [training myself on how to build efficient data models](11).  

### Other interesting stuff I've done in the last few years

* I started work on a side-project, [AnswerTime](12)
* I raised [Â£560k of non-dilutive funding to build a machine learning (ML) model](13) that can predict the safety of utilities worksites across the UK
* I ran [further and faster than the previous year](14) and ran 5k in less than 21 minutes
