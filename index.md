Hello. Here's a little information about me. 

I'm a Senior Product Designer building a platform for a smarter, fairer entertainment industry at <a href="http://www.wegotpop.com">We Got POP â†—</a>. I built this Jekyll site to host <a href="../portfolio">my portfolio</a> and <a href="../blog">blog</a>.

My career, thus far, has combined three interconnected disciplines; design, growth and storytelling. This combination enables me to do the work I do today:

* Strategy, vision and mission; crafting design strategies to help the company reach its goals and communicate them across the team
* User research and validation; I'm a proponent for placing user-centred design at the heart of the Agile process, conducting field studies and surfacing insights quickly so that the team can make faster decisions
* Design assets; I use Figma to create boards and prototypes to communicate my ideas 
* Measuring value; I am data-driven and well-versed in writing SQL (PostgresQL and MySQL) to query databases and building custom reports to visualise and interpret the data

I offer coaching and mentorship sessions over lunch, email me to find out more and book a slot (mail [at] johnhayn.es).

In the last 7+ years I have worked on a variety of digital products and services including:

* Native iOS and Android apps
* B2C subscription services
* SaaS web platforms 
* White-label enterprise software
* Designing and publishing design systems


In my spare time:

* I enjoy getting out for a run
* I held an advisory position for GoVia Thameslink between 2015 and 2019
* I play guitar for <a href="https://thegreatfire.co.uk">The Great Fire</a>
* I (build and) maintain websites for my friends: <a href="http://printersplayhouse.co.uk">Printer's Playhouse</a> and <a href="http://moarguitars.com">Moar Guitars</a>
* I'm currently learning as much as I can about web3 technology
