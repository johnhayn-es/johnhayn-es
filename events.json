I think they should now actually be properly re-surfaced.  One is on Green Street outside Cafe Corro, the second is in Green Street near the junction of Okehurst Road.  I think it is inefficient to just keep patching the same holes rather than having a broader repair.\n\nI would be grateful if you would look into this and let me know the outcome."
