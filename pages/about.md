<h3>John Haynes is a User Experience Designer building a platform for a smarter, fairer entertainment industry at <a href="http://www.wegotpop.com" target="_blank">We Got POP</a></h3>

## About Me
I am a Senior Product Designer with considerable experience designing B2B SAAS products; conducting user research & analysis, introducing design systems, improving the navigation and overall information architecture - overseeing the entire design process from ideation to deployment.

My background on marketing has lead me to oversee the growth of two successful subscription products from the ground up; the Hairy Bikers’ Diet Club and YourWelcome. I’m currently deploying these skills on POP’s Crew Community.
  
In my spare time 

* I play guitar as one half of the acoustic duo Stacey & John and lead guitar for The Great Fire
* I enjoy getting out for a run
* I’m interested in the future of transport and have held an advisory position for GoVia Thameslink since 2015.
