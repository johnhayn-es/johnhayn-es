POP had a problem. Business was ramping up and clients were demanding more and more from the software. Design resource was thin on the ground and struggling to keep up with increasing demand. With no component library in place and an inexperienced designer at the helm, the design process was fraught with delays and tensions were running high. 

**Platform:** Web
**Role:** Senior Product Designer

## Objective(s)

* Make the user experience across the platform more consistent
* Reduce the time between design brief and handover to development
* Set up tools and processes that lead to consistent output from all members of a growing design team

## Discovery
Work began by engaging stakeholders from senior leadership, along with members of the product and development teams. After collating responses from all parties, it was clear that there were two key problems: 

* The inconsistent user exerpeince was straining the customer success / account management teams
* There was high demand for new functionality, which was largely being met with completely bespoke components and workflows

Upon further investigation I discovered that the design team were using Sketch and had started building out a component library, but only a small minority of the platform components were included. While some of styles were similar, the components did not match the platform. With the best intentions, designs produced using these components were, at best, a loose guide for what should be included on a screen. 

## Design and Strategy
With the findings in mind, the decision was made to invest time in building out a library of consistent components in Sketch. Working with POP's team of front-end developers, we would update the component library to reflect the platform as it is today:

* Eliminate discrepancies between designs and implementation by updating the library to ensure that fonts, colours and spacing was consistent with the platform stylesheet 
* Leverage existing frameworks and javascript libraries that we're already using to design new components

### Educating the team
I collaborated with key stakeholders within the product team to ensure they understood the objectives of the work that we were undertaking and enable opportunities for them to provide feedback. This included: 

* Running two lunch'n'learn sessions about design systems (Google's Material Design and the Atomic Design principles by Brad Frost)
* Establishing fortnightly check-in meetings to showcase our work and monthly retros to debrief on the impact of completed design work 

### Bringing everyone with us
How can different teams release new features, autonomously, that feel like their part of the same platform? 

A consistent user experience starts with a shared product and user experience vision. 

I worked with the Head of Product to establish and publish our [Product Principles](https://medium.com/we-got-pop-design/product-principles-at-pop-448ed2f9b28c) (and later, internally, our User Experience Principles). 

This is a framework at the highest level, providing all members of all teams with a framework to assess the viability of a proposed solution or design. 

## Results and Impact
By the nature of the product, POP's key userbase is largely transient. At the time we undertook this work, there were very few users that had used the platform for more than one production - so we needed to look elsewhere to understand whether the changes we had made had impacted the consistency of the user experience. 

Two KPIs were identified; the amount of time it took to train new users (external) and the average time taken to deliver a validated design. At the time of writing, it's too early to understand the true impact - but the internal response to our approach has been unanimously positive.
