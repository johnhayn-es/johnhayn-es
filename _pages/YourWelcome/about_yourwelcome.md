### My Role 

Following YourWelcome's launch, I joined the team as the Head of Growth to focus on user acquisition & retention, and to oversee delivery of the B2C product. In this time we grew from having 50 tablets in the wild to more than 15000, spread across more than 50 worldwide countries/territories. As the company continued to grow, I was asked to oversee the design & delivery of the YourWelcome's apps and web dashboard as the Chief Product Officer.
