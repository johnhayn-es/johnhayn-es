## Project outline
Since the beginning of 2020 I've been part of a small team at POP charged with building and launching an integrated Payroll solution built specifically to cater for the intricacies of film and television production contracts. Production accountants currently export sheets of sensitive data and share it with third parties who manage payroll for them, creating unnecessary risk and arbitrary deadlines. Production companies have already been using POP to contract their crews and manage their timesheets; building out a payroll service would provide the production's accounts team with controls to create payrolls and give them full visibility as their processed by the POP back-office team. 

As the sole designer on this project I have become deeply entrenched in the delivery team, oversseing the research and design process alongside the newly-hired Lead Product Manager. 

After deploying a number of milestone releases focused on setting up the back-end, we began to reach an inflection point and needed to validate our user flows within the product. 


## Research objective(s)
The early stages of this project involved a number of field studies (~50 participants), through which we built a relationship with a number of Production Accountants, Financial Controllers and other finance professionals involved in HETV production. We're releveraging this test group to determine:

* The usability of a few key features; 
	* Creating a draft payroll
	* Getting a payroll approved by other payroll owners
	* Submitting payrolls to the POP team
	* Running a payroll and paying the crew
* How our proposal compares to our competition
* Propensity to pay and guidance on pricing
* An overall satisfaction rating (useful for hyping up internal stakeholders)

## Approach
The Product Lead and I identified [Useberry]() as a potential remote-first research tool and began a trial to assess its potential. Useberry enables us to create a scenario for participants to complete from their browser. Each scenario comprises of various questions, tasks and 

### Scenario planning
Production payroll is a repeated weekly process where the same actions happen at similar times on the same day each week: 

* Monday and Tuesday; collate payroll(s) from approved timesheets, expenses (additionals), holiday payments and any scheduled salaries (PAYE etc)
* Wednesday: get approval from the Financial Controller and Line Producer for each payroll 
* Thursday and Friday: calculating tax and pension contribution^, doing final checks^ and running payroll^ (^ usually done by a third party service)  

We used this schedule as the template of the Useberry scenario; we laid out the tasks and questions to emulate the weekly tasks, hoping this would put the participants in the right mindset to accurately complete the tasks and compare it to their current service provider.

### Methods
The research methods used in these scenarios were as follows:

* Binary success / treejack survey; Useberry creates heatmaps of the prototype tasks, enabling us to track the binary success of a task and/or the flow the user took during their attempt
* Confidence rating; after each set of tasks, we followed up with a confidence rating that enables us to map the entire journey
* Time taken; we can check for any sticking points

## Outcome(s)
I put together a deck in Google Slides as an internal reference for everyone working on the Payroll team. The slide deck is linked to a spreadsheet which converts Useberry exports into charts and summarised, attributed quotes. These slides were specifically designed to be copied into other decks to expedite and standardise the reporting of the test to internal stakeholders.

### Cohort analysis
We split our networks into cohorts of participants and create specific links to separately track their progress and feedback. I'm able to track this in the reporting; for example, splitting internal and external participants.

### Customer journey map
This scenario synthesises the end-to-end journey of making a payroll payment through POP. I plotted each cohort's task ratings on a chart to map the user experience at each stage of the journey. I also collated the feedback pertaining to each step below the chart, so the team can understand how each part of the journey can be improved. 

It's early days, but the initial feedback has highlighted actionable improvements; unclear labelling and the visibility of buttons being the most prominent.

### Summary
This project is currently ongoing and I am unable to go into much detail as it is yet to be released. Further details upon request.
