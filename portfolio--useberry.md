## Project outline
Since the beginning of 2020 I've been part of a small team at POP charged with building and launching an integrated Payroll solution built specifically to cater for the intricacies of film and television production contracts. 

Production accountants currently hand over this task to Payroll services, which provide little-to-no visibility of the processes. 

Production companies have already been using POP to contract their crews and manage their timesheets; building out a payroll service would provide the production's accounts team with controls to create payrolls, collate the necessary approvals, run the payroll and automatically schedule pension and HMRC payments from one platform. 

As the sole designer on this project I have become deeply entrenched in the delivery team, oversseing the research and design process alongside the newly-hired Lead Product Manager. 

The early stages of this project involved a number of field studies, through which we built a relationship with a nu mber of Production Accountants, Financial Controllers and other finance professionals involved in HETV production. 

After deploying a number of milestone releases focused on setting up the back-end, we began to reach an inflection point and needed to validate our user flows within the product. 

### Objective(s)

* Create a time-efficient activity; while many of the people in our networks are advocates and deeply invested in what we're building, they're also very busy and giving up their time for nothing - we should be mindful that we're not wasting their time
* The solution should be remote-first; due to variable restrictions and schedules, it's not possible for us to make on-site visits
* Accurately track key participants; while we anticipate capturing feedback at scale, it should be possible for us to hone in on key groups

## Approach
The Product Lead and I identified [Useberry]() as a potential remote-first research tool and began a trial to assess its potential. 

### What is Useberry
Useberry enables us to create a scenario for participants to complete from their browser. Each scenario comprises of various questions, tasks and 

### Scenario planning
Production accountants run a weekly process where they attempt to gather time and pay information, chase for approvals and spend way too much time attempting to reconcile everything - only to export all the information and send it to a payroll bureau (a service company set up to protect the liability) whose smoke-and-mirrors processes cause anxiety until everyone gets paid.

### Cohort analysis
We split our networks into cohorts of participants and create specific links to separately track their progress and feedback

## Outcome
The objectives for this project are: 

- Cut up to 2 days off of the current weekly process by handling approvals on-platform
- Create an end-to-end solution for production to hire, manage and pay their crew
- Create a service with higher transparency - put production accountants back in control
