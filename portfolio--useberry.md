## Project outline
Since the beginning of 2020 I've been part of a small team at POP charged with building and launching an integrated Payroll solution built specifically to cater for the intricacies of film and television production contracts. Production accountants currently export sheets of sensitive data and share it with third parties who manage payroll for them, creating unnecessary risk and arbitrary deadlines. Production companies have already been using POP to contract their crews and manage their timesheets; building out a payroll service would provide the production's accounts team with controls to create payrolls and give them full visibility as their processed by the POP back-office team. 

As the sole designer on this project I have become deeply entrenched in the delivery team, oversseing the research and design process alongside the newly-hired Lead Product Manager. 

After deploying a number of milestone releases focused on setting up the back-end, we began to reach an inflection point and needed to validate our user flows within the product. 


## Research objective(s)
The early stages of this project involved a number of field studies (~50 participants), through which we built a relationship with a number of Production Accountants, Financial Controllers and other finance professionals involved in HETV production. We're releveraging this test group to determine:

* The usability of a few key features; 
	* Creating a draft payroll
	* Getting a payroll approved by other payroll owners
	* Submitting payrolls to the POP team
	* Running a payroll and paying the crew
* How our proposal compares to our competition
* Propensity to pay and guidance on pricing
* An overall satisfaction rating (useful for hyping up internal stakeholders)

## Approach
The Product Lead and I identified [Useberry]() as a potential remote-first research tool and began a trial to assess its potential. Useberry enables us to create a scenario for participants to complete from their browser. Each scenario comprises of various questions, tasks and 

### Scenario planning
Production accountants run a weekly process where they attempt to gather time and pay information, chase for approvals and spend way too much time attempting to reconcile everything - only to export all the information and send it to a payroll bureau (a service company set up to protect the liability) whose smoke-and-mirrors processes cause anxiety until everyone gets paid.
