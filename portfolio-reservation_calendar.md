It became clear that the YourWelcome tablet would become a much more powerful tool if we were able to attribute in-app behaviour to a particular guest. This would provide a wealth of guest data that we now take for granted.

### Objective(s)
Users should be able to create, edit and delete a variety of events in a calendar.

The calendar system is used to:

* View & edit bookings
* View & approve service requests
* Setting custom reminders
* Integrate with external reservations calendars (HomeAway, Booking.com etc)

The calendar will be integrated with other external calendars; guest reservations will be imported from third parties, so the system must adhere to web standards (such as ISO 8601, handling timezones).

### Result
The calendar has become the backbone of a number of systems in the YourWelcome ecosystem.

* Can integrate 7+ external calendars, including HomeAway and Booking.com
* Enables property managers to sell of late check-outs, via YourWelcome services

### Impact

This key feature has enabled us to link in-app events to individual bookings; we now customise the guest’s experience based on past behaviour, as well as providing more detailed sales and analytical reporting to our clients.

* ~10000+ reservations added/imported per month in 2018
* 70% YourWelcome customers have connected a third party calendar
* Late check-outs have become YourWelcome’s most-sold additional service
