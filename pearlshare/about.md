## My Roles
### Growth Lead
I joined Pearlshare to lead user acquisition & retention for Pearlshare's iOS app; creating automated email campaigns, setting up Google Analytics funnels & goals, establishing an editorial voice/tone for in-app content.

### User Experience Lead
I later took the role of User Experience Lead and focused on Pearlshare's design and user experience, overseeing the development of the popular iOS app and the launch of pearlshare.com.
