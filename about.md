John Haynes is a Senior Product Designer building a platform for a smarter, fairer entertainment industry at <a href="http://www.wegotpop.com target+_blank">We Got POP  ↗</a>.

## Professional Experience
I am a Senior Product Designer with experience designing B2B SAAS products; conducting user research & analysis, introducing design systems, improving the navigation and overall information architecture - overseeing the entire design process from ideation to deployment.

My background on marketing has lead me to oversee the growth of two successful subscription products from the ground up; the Hairy Bikers’ Diet Club and YourWelcome. I’m currently deploying these skills on POP’s Crew Community.
  
## Outside of Work
In my spare time:

* I play guitar as one half of the acoustic duo <a href="https://staceyandjohn.co.uk">Stacey & John</a> and lead guitar for <a href="https://thegreatfire.co.uk">The Great Fire</a>

* I build boutique guitar pedals via <a href="http://hayneseffects.com">Haynes Effects</a>
* I enjoy getting out for a run
* I’m interested in the future of transport and held an advisory position for GoVia Thameslink between 2015 and 2019.
