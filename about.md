I am a Senior Product Designer with considerable experience designing B2B SAAS products; conducting user research & analysis, introducing design systems, improving the navigation and overall information architecture - overseeing the entire design process from ideation to deployment.

In my spare time

* I play guitar for [The Great Fire](http://www.thegreatfire.co.uk) and as one half of [Stacey & John](http://www.staceyandjohn.co.uk)
* I enjoy getting out for a run
* Iâ€™m interested in the future of transport and held an advisory position for GoVia Thameslink (Southern Railway, Thameslink etc) between 2015 and 2019.
