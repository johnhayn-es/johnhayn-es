### John Haynes is a User Experience Designer building a platform for a smarter, fairer entertainment industry at [We Got POP](http://www.wegotpop.com).


## About
I am a Senior Product Designer at [We Got POP](http://www.wegotpop.com), formerly CPO at [YourWelcome](http://www.yourwelcome.com) and an erstwhile cameraman and content producer. 

I have considerable experience designing B2B SAAS products; user research & analysis, introducing design systems, improving the navigation and overall information architecture - overseeing the entire design process from ideation to deployment.

My background on marketing has lead me to oversee the growth of two successful subscription products from the ground up; the Hairy Bikers’ Diet Club and YourWelcome. I’m currently deploying these skills on POP’s Crew Community.

In my spare time: 

* I play guitar as one half of the acoustic duo Stacey & John
* I enjoy getting out for a run
* I’m interested in the future of transport and have held an advisory position for GoVia Thameslink since 2015.
