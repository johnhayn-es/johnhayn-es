## Project outline and my role
For the first few months of 2020 I worked with POP's Head of Product to pull together our ideas for how an integrated Payroll solution could look. Production companies were already using POP to contract their crews and manage their timesheets, so paying them through the same platform felt like a natural progression. In April of the same year, we were given the go-ahead to start building out a new service.

As the sole designer on this project I have become deeply entrenched in the delivery team, oversseing the end-to-end research and design process alongside the newly-hired Product Lead. 

### Outcome
POP's Payroll service is due to launch in Q4 2021.

## Objectives
Production accountants run a weekly process where they attempt to gather time and pay information, chase for approvals and spend way too much time attempting to reconcile everything - only to export all the information and send it to a payroll bureau (a service company set up to protect the liability) whose smoke-and-mirrors processes cause anxiety until everyone gets paid.

Production accountants have no visibility of the processes. 

The objectives for this project are: 

- Cut up to 2 days off of the current weekly process by handling approvals on-platform
- Create an end-to-end solution for production to hire, manage and pay their crew
- Create a service with higher transparency - put production accountants back in control
