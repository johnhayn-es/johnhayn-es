In a [recent post](/jekyll-for-good), I mentioned that I would be continuing to teach myself how to build and deploy websites via Github Pages by building websites for good causes. The [new site for Printers Playhouse](https://www.printersplayhouse.co.uk) has been live for just over two weeks and we've already seen more than 500 people come to the site.

## Why Printers?
At the end of 2017 I was in a bad place. Recently separated from a partner of 10 years, sharing a bunk bed at my parents house with brother (who was going through a similar situation). I needed to throw myself into something new and spend some time figuring out what was important to me. I've played guitar for a few years and decided this was probably the best vehicle to get out and meet new people.

The Open Mic night at Printers Playhouse was my salvation. 2 years on and everything has changed. Printers is where my Fianc√©e and I first met (we're in the house band together). 

Like many independent, family-run businesses - they had an underperforming website and lacked the skills and/or budget to sort it out. For these reasons, I stepped in to offer my services. 

The Printers Playhouse website became my first pro bono "external client" website.

## Client Requirements
I worked with the Printers team to identify the key requirements of their ideal website: 

* A filterable events page, where people can see all events that are occuring in the next few weeks
* Dedicated pages for the theatre and for the regular 'get involved' nights (e.g. the open stage night, community choir etc)
* Modern styling with a simple colour scheme that reflects the Printers brand
* The ability to see which content is most popular

Outside of this meager list, I was given a free reign.
