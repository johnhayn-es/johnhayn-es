At the start of the year, I challenged myself to rebuild my personal site using Github Pages. Since then, I've been on a small spree - working on numerous sites to further my understanding of front-end design, styling and deploying to multiple sites via Github. 

I first started "building websites" for bands that I was in (or bands of friends) in 2006; injecting (horrendous) code into their MySpace pages, overlaying the original design with one of my own. 

I'm currently involved in a couple of musical projects, so it felt like a good place to start. 

## Stacey & John

My Fianc√©e and I have been playing music together for the entirety of our relationship. I had originally hosted our page over on Squarespace, but we decided that their costly monthly fees could be better spent on marketing our eclectic acoustic act. 

### Design Criteria
* Simple, one-page layout; optimised for traffic from social networks
* Contact form, enabling people to send a booking enquiry
* Mobile-first or heavily optimised for mobile

I used the [Agency template](https://github.com/y7kim/agency-jekyll-theme), which I have found increasingly challenging and hard to use. Inital set-up was fine - but the template seems to ignore certain values in the `config` file and `includes`, which has lead me to override a number of elements that should have built themselves.

After about 4 hours work, I'm pleased with the result.

### Next Steps
* Add a set list page
* Add SEO-targeting pages
* <strike>Hook up our custom URL and complete the switch over</strike>

## The Great Fire

Starting in 2020, The Great Fire is our new four-piece covers group. There's a lot of competition for this type of band in search results, but so many of them do a poor job of their SEO that I believe I can build a competitive site within our first 12 months.

### Design Criteria
* Rich site design with multiple pages and blog feeds
* Contact form, enabling people to send a booking enquiry

I used the [Forty template](https://github.com/andrewbanchich/forty-jekyll-theme) which, in my opinion, is brilliant. It has been incredibly easy to customise and seems very well put together. I've barely touched the site so far, but am already very happy with the result. 

I immediately replaced the naff header with an SVG, something I've never implemented myself before. Getting the SVG added was easy, but I probably spent 2 hours learning how to scale it on multiple screens and devices. I'm also currently struggling with some wayward CSS that means I'm currently unable to use it as a link.

### Next Steps
* <strike>Continue building out the site content</strike>
* <strike>Get that SVG logo linked to the root of the page</strike> (this was much harder than I thought!)
* Add SEO-targeting pages
* <strike>Purchase a URL and link it up</strike>
