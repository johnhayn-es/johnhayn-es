**Senior Product Designer**

I joined POP to help build a smarter, fairer entertainment industry. 

I lead the design team and am the principal designer on the [Production Portal â†—] [1]{:target="_blank"}, a service that production companies use to manage their productions. Features include contracting, messaging, timesheets and reports.

Due to the nature of the projects I'm working on, I'm unable to publish a lot of my most recent work.
