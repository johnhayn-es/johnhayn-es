I lead a cross-functional team at FYLD that secured £560,000 of non-dilutive funding from the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM), as part of its inaugural Strategic Innovation Fund grants.

The project focused on predicting high risk worksites – the next step towards a ‘zero-harm’ vision for the utilities industry, powered by AI.

We laid the groundwork for FYLD’s Predictive Safety Interventions – a safety system dedicated to accurately predicting and mitigating safety incidents on site or out in the field. Using a combination of FYLD’s proprietary data and SGN’s safety incident information, we  four key stages: identifying relevant data, applying machine learning, identifying key correlating factors, and showing that safety risk can be algorithmically predicted.

The ultimate goal is to achieve a ‘zero-harm’ outcome for companies using FYLD’s solution, by recording zero incidents out in the field. Using data, AI, and innovation, there is an opportunity to create a safer, more predictable, and lower risk working environment for every fieldworker, on every job. This technology enables field workers to return home safely every day after working in hazardous environments.
