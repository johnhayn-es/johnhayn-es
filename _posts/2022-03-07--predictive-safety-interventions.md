FYLD, in partnership with SGN, has secured close to £60,000 of funding from the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM), as part of its inaugural Strategic Innovation Fund grants.

This initiative will enable FYLD to undertake an eight-week feasibility study focused on predicting high risk sites – the next step towards a ‘zero-harm’ vision for the utilities industry, powered by AI.

During this two-month period, the awarded funds will be utilised to progress development of FYLD’s Predictive Safety Interventions – a safety system dedicated to accurately predicting and mitigating safety incidents on site or out in the field. FYLD imagines a world where, early in a shift, a remote safety manager knows which sites to intervene on to stop potentially life changing events from materialising.

Using a combination of FYLD’s proprietary data and SGN’s safety incident information, FYLD will work over the coming weeks to assess the feasibility of a solution over four key stages: identifying relevant data, applying machine learning, identifying key correlating factors, and showing that safety risk can be algorithmically predicted.

The ultimate goal is to achieve a ‘zero-harm’ outcome for companies using FYLD’s solution, by recording zero incidents out in the field. Using data, AI, and innovation, there is an opportunity to create a safer, more predictable, and lower risk working environment for every fieldworker, on every job. This technology enables field workers to return home safely every day after working in hazardous environments.
