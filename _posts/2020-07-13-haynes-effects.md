title: How I built... Haynes Effects
---
This build is a little more special than usual. Not only did I build a release a new, one-page website - after many months of working on the concept I also designed, built and released the guitar pedals that are on offer. 

On this project, I learned about the following:
* Designing and exporting SVGs
* Relative and Absolute URLs via Liquid handlerbars
* Soldering, drilling Aluminium and water-slide decals
* Ordering and importing hardware components from China
