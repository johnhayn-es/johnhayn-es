Earlier this year I challenged myself to start building websites (again), using Jekyll via Github Pages. Since January, I have published three sites:

* This site; migrating my design portfolio from Squarespace
* [staceyandjohn.co.uk](https://www.staceyandjohn.co.uk); a site for our acoustic duo
* [thegreatfire.co.uk](https://www.thegreatfire.co.uk); a site for our band

Working on these projects reawakened a dormant passion for website design. 

I want to learn more about Jekyll. I want to better understand how to use Liquid. By the end of the year I want to have published my own Jekyll template, rather than modifying other peoples.

Rather than needlessly experimenting on sites that I've already published, I decided that I needed to find some new challenges that I can apply myself to; a project I'm calling 'Jekyll for Good' 

### Jekyll For Good
The premise is simple; identify good causes with no or nascent web presence, then spend a couple of weeks building them something (in my spare time). This is not a professional service - I just want to use my spare time and experience to support others. If anyone insists, I will ask them to [make a donation to my chosen charity](http://www.tuesdayoharafund.co.uk/). 

Currently underway:

* Printers Playhouse; a local community arts hub that I've become increasingly involved with. 
* Moar Guitars; a tiny independent luthier whose guitars I greatly admire

Potential projects: 

* [The Tuesday Ohara Fund](http://www.tuesdayoharafund.co.uk/); a local charity that is very close to my heart
