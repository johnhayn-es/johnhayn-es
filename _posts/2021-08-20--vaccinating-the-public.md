This article summarises what has been a wholey worthwhile and satisfying experience, with a complete teardown of a terrible digital experience thrown in for good measure. Overall, I would highly recommend volunteering - whether it's via the incredible St John's Ambulance, or for someone else. The words of critique in this article are meant in good faith. 

### How I got started
Thanks to the various lockdowns, I'm now working 100% remotely from the office in my house in Eastbourne. After regaining 5hr+ a day that I'd previously spent commuting, I was looking for ways to make use of this new spare time. I started running again. I created a detailed project plan for all the DIY for our new house. I designed and built a proprietary guitar pedal. The devil makes works for idle thumbs.

In December 2020, I signed up to volunteer with St John's Ambulance to administer the COVID-19 vaccine(s). 

I was immediately invited for an interview and subsequently accepted the role. After this, I received an invite to begin the online training, a pre-requisite to the in-person vaccine training scheduled for the end of the month. 

### Training
The online training consisted of a number of NHS and St John's Ambulance courses covering everything from vaccine policy to basic first-aid. In total it took about 16 hours to complete and provided me with an excellent understanding of what the vaccines were, how they differed to one another, how to capture consent when administering prescribed medication and how vaccine policy is created. The in-person training was an 8 hour affair. We covered hygeine, donning and doffing PPE, basic first aid and, naturally, how to administer a vaccine. 

### Volunteering experience
Once I was fully qualified, then came the nightmare of setting up and using GRS (Global Rostering System). 

GRS might be the most unintuitive app I've ever used. 

The sole purpose of the app is to enable St John's Volunteers to view upcoming shifts and volunteer their time, yet the user experience to actually complete this is, frankly, insane. I do not say this lightly. I almost wrote to St John's, offering to volunteer as a designer instead. 

For a minute, let's imagine the perfect experience: 

* I quickly authenticate my app login using biometric data (fingerprint or face)
* I am immediately presented with a list of nearby volunteer shifts
* After browsing through the shifts to find one that has a low number of volunteers

first shift, wrong day

All subsequent shifts
* policy change so completed induction
*
