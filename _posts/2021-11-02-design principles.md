I am guided by three personal design principles:

## Intention
The work I produce is justified and defensible. I will not start work on solutions until I deeply understand problem. I hold two views in parallel - the imediate solution and the longer-term strategic vision - and my work must serve both. 


## Collaboration
My role is to work-with and coach others to find the solution; this involves listening and understanding strategies and motivations, before acting. I am a bridge between other stakeholders and should use my unique perspective to ensure that 

## Accuracy 
The work I produce, particularly the results of research or analysis, is accurate and up-to-date.
