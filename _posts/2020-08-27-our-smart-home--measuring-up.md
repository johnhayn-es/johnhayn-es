This post is the first in what will no-doubt be a preposterously long series about purchasing and modernising our first home.

My partner and I are in the final stages of buying a house and, as a proud geek, the time came to start planning what we want our future home to be.

This blog will include notes about: 
* Tools that we used to plan the space
* Our plans to future-proof the house

## Planning the inside space
Personally, I’ve always found it easy to visualise how colours, light and shapes will appear in a physical space. However, not everyone finds this easy - and having clear visual aids can help when communicating our ideas.

### Floor plan
After purchasing a laser measure to record accurate internal measurements, I converted these into millimetre-perfect designs using [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/).

Doing this has enabled us to: 
* plan the placement of furniture and smart home devices
* make decisions about new purchases
* visualise how ideas for future renovations would change the house

### Visualising our new home
Though we’re busy building a budget to spend money we haven’t earned yet - we haven’t actually moved in to the property yet and we’re not due to complete until later this year. 

Viewing the property requires at least a week’s notice and, while they have been very accommodating, I’m sure the vendors would quickly tire of us if we visited as many times as we’d actually like to. 

Instead, we used the [Matterport](www.matterport.com) capture app (using my phone and a tripod) to quickly create an immersive 3D model of our new home.

We’ve regularly been using both models throughout the planning process. The 3D floor plan has been an invaluable asset for making decisions, particularly when it comes to deciding which combination of sofas to purchase. The Matterport scans may seem like a gimmick, but they have also proven useful for helping ourselves and loved ones interpret our plans by better visualising the space.
