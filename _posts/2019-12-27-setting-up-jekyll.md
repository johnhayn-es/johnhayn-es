title: Setting up Jekyll
---
I've begun to migrate my portfolio and blog from Squarespace to Jekyll, via Github Pages. 

This isn't my first rodeo - I've used Jekyll before, so setting up Jekyll was easy enough. I was also able to install and customise a new theme with relative ease. 

### Ambitions & Objectives
I made the decision to use this blog to test my design and web development skills as I continue to further my education in these areas through 2020.

* Simple styling; can I build a theme that focuses on ease-of-use and accessibility, while still acheiving the aesthetic I want?
* Helpful features; can I build upon the simple theme by integrating plugins, such as search?
* SEO optimisations; can I build a site that generates inbound traffic by optimising blog posts for SEO?

### Roadmap
There is no set timeframe for this project, but I will approach the set up in the following order: 

1. <strike>Set up Jekyll</strike>
2. <strike>Install a custom theme</strike>
3. <strike>Set up / transfer blog content</strike>
4. <strike>Create a page template for portfolio projects</strike>
5. <strike>Build-out pages for portfolio projects</strike>
6. Integrate site-search
