After 2 years of running their website and social accounts, Si and Dave asked me to project manage the launch of the Hairy Bikers Diet Club. 

I was handed the keys to the project six weeks prior to launching on January the first. My primary responsibility was working with our partners, SP Health, to deliver a Hairy Bikers version of their online diet plan website. 

I worked with Sue Douglas, then Deputy Editor of The Mirror, to plan a syndicated media campaign across Trinity Mirror Group titles to support the launch. I commissioned photography, ghost-wrote a number of articles and coordinated a schedule of media activities across their website and social channels. 

I used a tool called Thunerclap to enable fans of the Bikers to lend the reach of their own social channels and help us share our launch message on January the 1st. The message reached more than 1m social followers, propelling us to the third largest diet club in a highly competitive industry at that time of year. The launch activity was the most successful Thunderclap campaign of 2013.

It appears as though the Diet Club has now shut down.
