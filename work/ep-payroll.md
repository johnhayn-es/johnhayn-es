### TL;DR
When the Hollywood strikes forced us to pivot our business strategy, I designed and validated an MVP of an end-to-end contracting, timesheet and payroll system in just over two weeks. 

In that two-week period: 
* I leveraged the component library to quickly design and iterate multiple new features
* We validated the prototype with more than 15 Production Finance teams (eg. Netflix, the BBC etc)

The result was a development-ready reference design that demonstrated all of the happy and unhappy paths of our new service interface - which scored an average of 4.1 out of 5 indicatiive product satisfaction score.

This product is still in development and is due to be released in Q2 2024.

# Background
At the end of July 2023, Hollywood went on strike. 

Up until this point, our strategy had been to complete the rebuild of our Timesheets feature, before moving on to work almost exclusively on bringing an end-to-end production payroll service to market. 

The strikes forced our hand. Anticipating up to a 60% loss of revenue for the rest of the year, we decided to go all-in and work on both initiatives simultaneous - enabling us to go-to-market quickly after the strikes were broken. 

In order to stand a chance of delivering this in time (the predicted duration of the strikes was 3 months), the initial designs needed to be in the developers hands as quickly as possible.

### Challenges: 
* Hundreds of freelancers employed by a temporary company
	* Different tax statuses
	* Different deal terms
	* Working to different union agreements or contract terms
* Productions shooting in multiple territories and currencies - often at the same time, on the same production
* Production teams often contest that there is not enough time, incentive or expertise to roll out entertprise software - so resort to using paper, leading to high levels of noncompliance
* There is no agreed industry-wide standard; processes differ at best by per-territory and, at worst, by production
* As the sole designer on the Production Portal (the underlying platform that powers these separate features), I had to collaborate with the product team to ruthlessly prioritise my time. There were three development squads, each lead by a separate PM with their own to-do list. 
 
### Objectives
On the first day of the pivot, I partnered with the payroll PM to define success metrics for discovery process - how would we know when we'd done enough to get started? 

After much consideration we settled on the following objectives for this project: 
* Maximise the indicated product-satisfaction scores for all key user personas, do this by: 
	* Minimising the time it takes to prepare individual pay runs
	* Increase or maintain the accuracy of each pay run (eg. don't compromise accuracy for speed)
	* Minimise the number of revisions required

# Discovery and design validation 
Given the urgency of the project, we abandoned our usual and ran the disocvery and design processes in parallel. 

Mapped the jobs-to-be-done and then prioritised the individual user stories to determine the minimum viable scope. We then overlaid the current service design to determine initial scope - payroll handover process

Created initial design based on existing understanding and then iterated

Becasuse of the tight timeline, I published a deck with the results of each conversation - and a changelog for the prototype - this enabled stakeholders to keep up-to-date with the changes as we progressed.

We lined up 15 remote user interviews with Production Finance teams from across a range of productions 

Used Microsoft teams to record the reactions

Published a three-minute video teaser of the key challenges, feedback and excitement about our prototype - to share with execs and the board

# Summary and reflections
Overall, this project

### Wins
* Met the discovery KPIs 
* Created a solid design foundation that has remained largely unchanged
* Got stakeholders from across the business 

### Challenges
* Should have found a way to avoid the 80 hour weeks
