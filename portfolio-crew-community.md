## About the project 
The POP Crew Community is an ambitious, horizon three initiative that launched in September 2019. Our mission is to build a global community of experienced production crew and help them connect with people and job opportunities outside of their existing network. We are currently offering a tiered freemium/subscription service, which introduced a tertiary revenue stream prior to POP's Acqisition in early 2020.

### My role
As part of the founding Crew Community team, I have played a hybrid role on the project: 
* Design; research and design for all features in discovery
* Strategy; setting out the monthly initiatives and reporting results to our internal governance team
* Reporting; consolidating queries from our database with reporting from Stripe, Google Analytics to provide one view on all our KPIs

### Project Objectives
In the first twelve months:
* Grow the community to 29,000 free members; 12,000 UK/EU and 17,000 US
* Launch subscription product(s) and grow to 357 annual subscribers (Â£107k ARR)

## Design
For the MVP: 
* Leveraging existing POP platform technology
* mapping user flows for MVP
