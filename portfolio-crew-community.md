## About the project 
The POP Crew Community is an ambitious, horizon three initiative that launched in September 2019. Our mission is to build a global community of experienced production crew and help them connect with people and job opportunities outside of their existing network. We are currently offering a tiered freemium/subscription service, which introduced a tertiary revenue stream prior to POP's Acqisition in early 2020.

### My role
As part of the founding Crew Community team, I have played a hybrid role on the project: 

* Reporting; consolidating queries from our database with reporting from Stripe, Google Analytics to provide one view on all our KPIs
* Strategy; setting out the monthly initiatives and reporting results to our internal governance team
* Design; research and design for all features in discovery

### Objectives
In the first twelve months:

* Grow the community to ~29,000 free members; 12,000 UK/EU and 17,000 US
* Launch subscription product(s) and grow to 357 annual subscribers (Â£107k ARR)


## Research
Since launch, there have been two key phases of research activity; launching the subscription service and then iterative design of new value-adding features.

### Launching a subscription service
* Engaging stakeholders
* Pricing
* Research plan

### Adding value (discovery)
* User interviews

## Strategy and Approach

* User Flows
* Partnerships

## Result
