## Outcomes > output
Do the work to identify the desired outcome (of the user and the business) and prioritise the work that has the biggest positive impact towards it. It's ok to be busy, as long as what you're working on has a clear line of sight towards the goal. Don't be afraid to ask questions or change direction if the data shows that something isn't working.

## Tell stories 
Bring people with you by giving everything a beginning (context), middle (detail) and end (summary and recommendation). 

## Act with integrity
Do what you say you're going to do. Practice radical candor; keep everyone in-the-know in the know. No surprises. If you're dealing with customers, be honest and upfront about why you're talking to them - make sure you capture consent to use their information. 

## Automate and delegate
Do what you can to leave things in a better shape than you found them. Build reusable components and add them to the library. Categorise and label research notes so they can be reused. Focus on the _why_ and don't get lost in the _what_.
