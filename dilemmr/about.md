# Dilemmr
Before Facebook, Instagram and Twitter introduced polling features, there was no quick way to ask your followers their opinion and get quantified results. 

Dilemmr was my solution. The premise is simple; post your dilemmr (text, photo and two options), and anyone else playing helps choose your answer. Share your dilemmr on Facebook and let your friends anonymously answer it for you.

The app only made it as far as Testflight before the lead developer let me know he could no longer work on the project. The dream was over. What a dilemma.
