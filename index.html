<p>Hello. Here's a little information about me.</p>

<p>If you read my résumé you will notice that my career combines three interconnected disciplines; design, growth and storytelling. This combination enables me to do the work I do today. I am a full-stack designer; not only seeing the design process through from end-to-end, but also building a deep understanding of the levers for commercial and customer success.</p>

<p>I'm a jack of all trades:</p>

<ul>
<li>User research, ideation and validation; I'm a proponent for <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-centered-design">User Centered Design ↗</a>, focusing on the user's needs at each stage of the process.</li>
<li>Design iterations; I use the principles of <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Atomic Design ↗</a> to establish a library of reusable components that enable me to quickly create high-fidelity prototypes for user testing.</li>
<li>Developer handover; I believe that design and development is a collaborative process and make efforts to bring developers into the design process as early as possible, in order to deeply understand the technical challenges or opportunities that can be taken. I combine prototypes with annotated project files and, where necessary, author specific documentation to communicate how something is intended to work.</li>
<li>Measuring value; I am data-driven and well-versed in writing SQL (PostgresQL and MySQL) queries to surface data, then reporting the results (via a Google Sheets or data-vis tools like Domo or Data Studio). I use these skills at all stages of the design process and have also built reports for other key stakeholders to help them measure the impact of my designs.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the last 7+ years I have worked on a variety of digital products and services including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Native iOS and Android apps</li>
<li>B2C subscription services</li>
<li>SaaS web platforms</li>
<li>White-label enterprise software</li>
<li>Designing and publishing design systems</li>
</ul>

<P>I'm a Senior Product Designer building a platform for a smarter, fairer entertainment industry at <a href="http://www.wegotpop.com">We Got POP ↗</a>.</P>

<P>In my spare time:</P>

<ul>
<li>I play guitar as one half of the acoustic duo <a href="https://staceyandjohn.co.uk">Stacey & John</a> and guitar for <a href="https://thegreatfire.co.uk">The Great Fire</a></li>
<li>I (build and) maintain websites for my friends: <a href="http://printersplayhouse.co.uk">Printer's Playhouse</a> and <a href="http://moarguitars.com">Moar Guitars</a></li>
<li>I build boutique guitar pedals via <a href="http://hayneseffects.com">Haynes Effects</a></li>
<li>I enjoy getting out for a run</li>
<li>I’m interested in the future of transport and held an advisory position for GoVia Thameslink between 2015 and 2019.</li>
